🇮🇳 Project Name: BharatVerse – Capture, Create, Contribute

🎯 Tagline:
Preserving India’s Culture, One Voice at a Time.

💡 Project Idea Summary

Build an open-source web + mobile app where users can:

🎙️ Record audio, 📝 write stories, or 📷 submit images/memes about their regional language, local tradition, festivals, or folklore
🌐 The app uses AI to transcribe, translate, and tag content, storing it in a public cultural corpus (open dataset)
📤 Community can browse, contribute, remix, and download data for research, education, or fun
🧠 Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, with open dataset on Hugging Face or GitHub
🔧 Modules & Features
This app will have the following modules and features:
1. 🎙️ Audio Capture & Transcription
Record local stories or chants
Use Whisper (open-source) to transcribe audio
Optional: Translate using IndicTrans / iNLTK
2. 📝 Text Contribution
Add local proverbs, idioms, phrases
Describe traditions, customs, festivals
Language tagging & validation using NLP
3. 📸 Image Upload + Captioning
Upload images of artwork, festivals, symbols
AI generates cultural captions (via BLIP2 or similar)
4. 🧠 Smart Tagging
AI suggests tags (e.g., "Pongal", "Marathi", "Folk Song") using classification or zero-shot NLP
5. 💬 Community & Remix
Users can view/download stories
Export as JSON/CSV
Remix content for podcasts, videos, etc.
6. 📚 Corpus Builder
Auto-organizes content by language, region, theme
Provides downloadable open-source dataset
