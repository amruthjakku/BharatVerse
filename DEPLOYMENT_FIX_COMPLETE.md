# 🚨 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIXES APPLIED

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE FIXES COMPLETED**

### **Problem Identified:**
The Streamlit Cloud deployment was failing due to:
1. **Hidden comments in packages.txt** causing apt-get errors
2. **Complex dependencies** in requirements.txt
3. **Complex imports** in Home.py causing import errors

### **Solutions Applied:**

---

## 🔧 **Fix 1: Clean packages.txt** ✅
**Before:**
```
# System packages required for BharatVerse  ← THIS CAUSED THE ERROR
libsndfile1
ffmpeg
...
```

**After:**
```
ffmpeg
libsndfile1
```

**Result:** ✅ No more apt-get errors about packages named "#", "System", etc.
