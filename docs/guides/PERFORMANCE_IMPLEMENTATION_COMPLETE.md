## 🎯 HOW TO USE THE OPTIMIZATIONS

### 1. **Immediate Benefits (No Configuration Needed)**

```python
# Automatic caching for expensive operations
@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)
def expensive_operation():
    return process_data()

# Memory monitoring
from utils.memory_manager import show_memory_dashboard
show_memory_dashboard()

# Performance tracking
from utils.performance_optimizer import get_performance_optimizer
optimizer = get_performance_optimizer()
```

### 2. **Launch Your Optimized App**

```bash
# Set up performance environment
source scripts/setup_env.sh

# Launch with all optimizations active
streamlit run Home.py
```

### 3. **Monitor Performance**

```bash
# Run performance tests
python scripts/performance_test.py

# Access admin dashboard in the app
# Navigate to: ⚡ Performance page
```

---

## 🚀 FOR FULL BENEFITS - CONFIGURE EXTERNAL SERVICES

### Environment Variables:
```bash
# Set up Redis for caching
export REDIS_URL="redis://your-redis-instance:6379"

# Configure Supabase
export POSTGRES_HOST="your-supabase-host"
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD="your-password"
```

### Streamlit Secrets:
```toml
[redis]
url = "redis://your-redis-instance:6379"

[postgres]
host = "your-supabase-host"
password = "your-password"
database = "bharatverse"

[app]
enable_caching = true
cache_ttl_hours = 24
memory_threshold_mb = 500
```
